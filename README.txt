OpenAccess_EPUB seeks to be an entirely self-sufficient program that only requires the input of the archival XML files and produce an ebook file in accordance with the EPUB specifications.
Such a format could benefit the open access movement by opening a new channel for distribution that may proivde a more optimal reading environment for some readers.
In contrast to the convention of online digital publishing of scientific journalism via PDF, which stresses fidelity to the printed page, reflowable ebook formats allow readers to alter text size, width, and font for improved reading (a very notable benefit for the visually impaired) while still exercising almost as full a range of hypertextual enhancements as available to PDF (the notable distinctions being the lack of direct* video and audio support on most reading systems; this is a minute disadvantage considering the rarity of their implementation in scientific literature).

*Most reading systems, including more modern reading devices support web browsing.
