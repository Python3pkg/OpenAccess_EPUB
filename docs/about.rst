About OpenAccess_EPUB
=====================

This project was started with the goal of making OpenAccess scientific journalism more accessible and more available. E-books are a more
adaptable format for mobile and desktop devices alike, and (especially in conjunction with other technologies) can help to alleviate some
reading impairments.

I am a strong supporter of OpenAccess publishing and believe that the world can always do with a little more scientific literacy. I hope that
this project contributes at least somewhat to this aim.

OpenAccess_EPUB is a one-person show at the moment, but as always I would be more than happy to have help. If you would like to contribute
your time, advice, or expertise to this project, please contact `me on GitHub <https://github.com/SavinaRoja>`_.
