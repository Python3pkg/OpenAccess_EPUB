OpenAccess_EPUB is a program for converting OpenAccess Academic Journal
articles into the ePub format. There are reasons why this is important:

* Accessibility: ebooks are a friendlier format for those with visual and
reading disabilities.

* Portability: ebooks work on many platforms where static text documents such
as PDFs don't perform as well.

* Hypertextuality: ebooks and hypertext go together with ease

This program is currently being developed for PLoS and Frontiers and is meant
to be easily extensible to add support for further publishers in the future.
For a prototype version that works fairly reliably on PLoS articles, see the
downloads page at:
https://github.com/SavinaRoja/OpenAccess_EPUB/downloads
for version 0.1.0.

Getting Started
---------------
Nicer documentation for users wishing to use the program is on the wiki:
https://github.com/SavinaRoja/OpenAccess_EPUB/wiki

OpenAccess_EPUB is a CLI tool implemented in Python to convert articles
to ePub. The user can indicate the desired content in three ways: path to
local file, URL, or Digital Object Identifier (DOI). 

From the program directory, try:
python main.py -i path/to/local/xml_file

How to Contribute
-----------------
If you would like to contribute to the project, there are many ways to do so. 
If you know Python and would like to assist in development, contact me and we 
can discuss collaboration. Feedback regarding bugs, presentation, formatting, 
and accessibility are all quite valuable.
