Introduction
------------
OpenAccess_EPUB is a I created with the broad goal of bringing OpenAccess (OA) 
journal articles and content into the modern e-book format. EPUB was a natural 
choice for format and so I began to develop a tool to translate from the XML 
PLoS presented for its articles to the EPUB2 format.

The project is still quite new, and is still only geared at supporting PLoS 
content. If more OA publishers expose suitable formats for translation, then 
the project should naturally expand. A significant advantage of the EPUB 
format is its increased accessibility for those with visual or reading 
impairments, as well as providing certain enhancements over standard PDF.

As I write this, PLoS publishes XML according to the Journal Publishing Tag
Set 2.0, but plans to move in a few months to Tag Set 3.0. EPUB3 also recently 
became the official current EPUB version. My goal is to be mostly ready for 
Journal Publishing Tag Set 3.0 to EPUB3 conversion by the time PLoS updates.

Getting Started
---------------
Nicer documentation for users wishing to use the program is on the wiki:
https://github.com/SavinaRoja/OpenAccess_EPUB/wiki

OpenAccess_EPUB is a CLI tool implemented in Python to convert PLoS articles
to EPUB. The user can indicate the desired content in three ways: path to
local file, PLoS URL, or Digital Object Identifier (DOI). 

From the program directory, try:
python main.py -i path/to/local/PLoS_xml_file

How to Contribute
-----------------
If you would like to contribute to the project, there are many ways to do so. 
If you know Python and would like to assist in development, contact me and we 
can discuss collaboration. Feedback regarding bugs, presentation, formatting, 
and accessibility are all quite valuable.
