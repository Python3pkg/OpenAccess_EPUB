OpenAccess_EPUB is a project I started with the goal of bringing OpenAccess(OA)
journal content into the world of ePub publishing. Right now it has focused
extensively on PLoS and provides very decent conversion from their internal
XML format (Journal Publishing Tag Set 2.0)

Though the program currently only works for PLoS publications, I hope to soon
begin developing the project for use with Frontiers. They use Journal
Publishing Tag Set 2.3.

Getting Started
---------------
Nicer documentation for users wishing to use the program is on the wiki:
https://github.com/SavinaRoja/OpenAccess_EPUB/wiki

OpenAccess_EPUB is a CLI tool implemented in Python to convert PLoS articles
to EPUB. The user can indicate the desired content in three ways: path to
local file, PLoS URL, or Digital Object Identifier (DOI). 

From the program directory, try:
python main.py -i path/to/local/PLoS_xml_file

How to Contribute
-----------------
If you would like to contribute to the project, there are many ways to do so. 
If you know Python and would like to assist in development, contact me and we 
can discuss collaboration. Feedback regarding bugs, presentation, formatting, 
and accessibility are all quite valuable.
