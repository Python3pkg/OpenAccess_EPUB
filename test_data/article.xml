<p>In fission yeast, the Swi5-Sfr1 complex plays an important role in homologous recombination (HR), a pathway crucial for the maintenance of genomic integrity. Here we identify and characterize mammalian Swi5 and Sfr1 homologues. Mouse Swi5 and Sfr1 are nuclear proteins that form a complex <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Swi5 interacts <italic>in vitro</italic> with Rad51, the DNA strand-exchange protein which functions during HR. By generating <italic>Swi5</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>Sfr1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> embryonic stem cell lines, we found that both proteins are mutually interdependent for their stability. Importantly, the Swi5-Sfr1 complex plays a role in HR when Rad51 function is perturbed <italic>in vivo</italic> by expression of a BRC peptide from BRCA2. <italic>Swi5</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>Sfr1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells are selectively sensitive to agents that cause DNA strand breaks, in particular ionizing radiation, camptothecin, and the Parp inhibitor olaparib. Consistent with a role in HR, sister chromatid exchange induced by Parp inhibition is attenuated in <italic>Swi5</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>Sfr1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells, and chromosome aberrations are increased. Thus, Swi5-Sfr1 is a newly identified complex required for genomic integrity in mammalian cells with a specific role in the repair of DNA strand breaks.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Our genome constantly undergoes DNA damage as a result of agents in the environment, as well as from metabolic processes. One method of repairing DNA damage is homologous recombination (HR), in which genetic information from a duplicate sequence (the sister chromatid) is copied into the damaged site in DNA. In model organisms (the yeasts), a protein complex termed Swi5-Sfr1 functions in DNA damage repair by HR. In this study, we characterize mouse homologues of this complex. We find that mouse cells lacking this complex are sensitive to DNA damaging agents, in particular, those that cause breaks in DNA strands and that serve as cancer chemotherapeutics. These cells also have increased numbers of chromosome aberrations when exposed to DNA damaging agents. Moreover, HR is decreased in Swi5 and Sfr1 mutant cells under conditions where the cell is challenged. Together, these results demonstrate a requirement for the Swi5-Sfr1 protein complex in maintaining genomic integrity in mammalian cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Homologous recombination (HR) is a key pathway in mammalian cells for the repair of several types of lesions, including DNA strand breaks. Its importance is emphasized by the sensitivity of HR mutants to a variety of DNA damaging agents, as well as the loss of genomic integrity seen in these mutants arising from DNA damage. As a result, HR is a critical DNA repair pathway during development and for tumor suppression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Moynahan1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-SanFilippo1">[2]</xref>.</p>
<p>Double-strand breaks (DSBs) arise in DNA as a result of both endogenous cellular processes and from exogenous sources <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Lindahl1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-vanGent1">[4]</xref>. HR is a precise pathway for the repair of DSBs, during which homologous sequence information is copied from an intact donor template <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Moynahan1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-SanFilippo1">[2]</xref>, most frequently the sister chromatid during late S/G2 in mitotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Johnson1">[5]</xref>. A second key pathway for the repair of DSBs is nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ), where two ends are joined with little or no sequence identity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Lieber1">[6]</xref>. In addition to canonical two-ended DSBs, one-ended DSBs also arise in DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Helleday1">[7]</xref>. These lesions form when a replication fork encounters a DNA single-strand break that is not repaired by base excision repair, for example, from a covalent topoisomerase I-DNA intermediate as a result of exposure to camptothecin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Strumberg1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-SalehGohari1">[9]</xref>. HR is the primary mechanism for the repair of one-ended DSBs, given that the joining of two unrelated one-ended DSBs by NHEJ would give rise to genomic rearrangements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Helleday1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>Many of the known HR factors in mammalian cells, including the central Rad51 protein, have been identified by their homology to yeast HR factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-SanFilippo1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Shinohara1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Yoshimura1">[11]</xref>. Rad51, the eukaryotic homologue of <italic>Eschericia coli</italic> RecA, binds to single-stranded DNA to form a nucleoprotein filament which catalyzes base pairing and strand exchange between homologous DNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Sung1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Yu1">[14]</xref>. Single-stranded DNA is formed at DNA ends by resection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Mimitou1">[15]</xref>; although a substrate for Rad51 filament formation, single-stranded DNA is also bound by replication factor A (RPA), which binds at high affinity and removes secondary structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Brill1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Sugiyama1">[17]</xref>. While critical for the initiation of HR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Sung2">[18]</xref>, RPA interferes with Rad51 loading onto single-stranded DNA. Several factors, referred to as “mediators”, are required to overcome the inhibition by RPA to facilitate Rad51 nucleoprotein filament formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Sung3">[19]</xref>. Proposed mediators in yeast include the Rad51 paralogues, Rad55-Rad57, and Rad52 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Sung4">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Sung5">[21]</xref>. Vertebrates have five Rad51 paralogues, of which a complex of two have been shown to have mediator activity <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Sigurdsson1">[22]</xref>. Additionally, the breast cancer suppressor BRCA2, for which there is no homologue in budding or fission yeast, has been proposed to have mediator activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-SanFilippo2">[23]</xref>. BRCA2 may also function to stabilize Rad51 filaments on single-stranded DNA, by inhibiting ATP hydrolysis while preventing the formation of non-productive filaments on double-stranded DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Carreira1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>A distinct complex that functions in fission yeast HR is Swi5-Sfr1. Mutation of either Swi5 or Sfr1 results in reduced HR in both mitotic and meiotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Khasanov1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Schmidt1">[28]</xref>. Like other HR mutants, Swi5 and Sfr1 mutants have elevated sensitivity to a number of DNA damaging agents, including ionizing radiation, UV, and methyl-methanesulfonate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Akamatsu2">[29]</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic>, the Swi5-Sfr1 complex binds to Rhp51 (the fission yeast Rad51 homologue) in an Sfr1-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Akamatsu2">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Haruta1">[30]</xref>, and has been shown to possess mediator activity but importantly also to enhance strand exchange by Rhp51 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Haruta1">[30]</xref>. While loss of either Swi5-Sfr1 or Rhp55-Rhp57 (fission yeast Rad55-Rad57 homologues) reduces HR, loss of both complexes complete abrogates Rhp51-dependent HR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Akamatsu1">[26]</xref>. Both complexes are also required during meiotic recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Hyppa1">[31]</xref>. Budding yeast has a homologous complex to Swi5-Sfr1 termed Sae3-Mei5, although this complex is only expressed during meiosis where it plays a critical role in meiotic recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-McKee1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Hayase1">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>Swi5 forms a second complex with an Sfr1-related protein, Swi2, which localizes to heterochromatin at the donor mating-type loci and promotes HR during switching <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Akamatsu1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Akamatsu2">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Jia1">[35]</xref>. In budding yeast, the function of Sae3-Mei5 appears to be limited to supporting the function of Dmc1, the meiosis-specific RecA homologue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Tsubouchi1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Hayase1">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>Previous reports suggest that both Swi5/Sae3 and Sfr1/Mei5 are evolutionarily conserved, while Swi2 is only found in fission yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Akamatsu2">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Hayase1">[34]</xref>. In this study, we isolated Swi5 and Sfr1 homologues from mice. Swi5 and Sfr1 form a complex <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, and Rad51 binding to Swi5 is detected <italic>in vitro</italic> in GST-pull down assays, suggesting that the Swi5-Sfr1 complex has a conserved function in mouse. To investigate their function <italic>in vivo</italic>, we generated <italic>Swi5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Sfr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell lines. Although loss of either Swi5 or Sfr1 did not decrease HR frequency by itself, HR was perturbed to a greater extent in these cells by expression of a BRC peptide from BRCA2. Interestingly, <italic>Swi5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Sfr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells were sensitive to ionizing radiation, camptothecin, and an inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (Parp), all of which cause strand breaks. The induction of sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) by Parp inhibition was attenuated in the Swi5 and Sfr1-deficient cell lines; moreover, Parp inhibition resulted in increased chromatid breaks and radial chromosomes in <italic>Swi5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Sfr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells. Thus, Swi5 and Sfr1 have an important role in the maintenance of genomic integrity in mammalian cells, in particular in the repair of DNA strand breaks.</p>

<title>Cloning and structure of mammalian Swi5 and Sfr1</title>
<p>Based on amino acid conservation, putative mammalian homologues of Swi5/Sae3 and Sfr1/Mei5 have previously been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Akamatsu2">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Hayase1">[34]</xref>. We cloned the mouse homologues, 2900010J23Rik for Swi5 and 6330577E15Rik for Sfr1, based on existing database information (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.informatics.jax.org/</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://uswest.ensembl.org/index.html" xlink:type="simple">http://uswest.ensembl.org/index.html</ext-link>). The Sfr1 cDNA was successfully amplified by PCR following reverse transcription (RT-PCR) of RNA obtained from mouse ES cells. Sequence analysis of the Sfr1 cDNA revealed that the Sfr1 protein is 303 amino acids and is encoded by four exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001160.s001">Figure S1A and S1B</xref>).

<p>Swi5 cDNAs were also obtained by RT-PCR of RNA from mouse ES cells. Two differentially spliced forms were detected containing alternative first exons which encoded proteins of 89 and 121 amino acids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001160.s002">Figure S2A and S2C</xref>). When expressed in ES cells, we found that both forms migrated at a lower molecular weight than the endogenous protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001160.s002">Figure S2B</xref>); attempts to clone a cDNA expressing a larger protein were unsuccessful, possibly because the 5′ end of the mRNA contains a structure which impedes amplification or a non-AUG initiation codon. Nevertheless, both forms complemented the phenotypes of <italic>Swi5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells (see below and data not shown). In subsequent experiments, we used the Swi5 cDNA encoding the 89 amino acid protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>
<p>Overall, the sequence identities between mouse and fission yeast proteins were 28.6% (Swi5) and 20.9% (Sfr1). Significant variation was noted between the N-terminus of the various Sfr1 orthologues, even among mouse strains. Mouse Sfr1 has a proline-rich repeat of 16 amino acids at its N-terminus, which we named the RSfp motif (<underline>r</underline>odent <underline>Sf</underline>r1 <underline>p</underline>roline rich motif) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001160.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). In the mouse ES cells used in this study (E14) and in DBA/2J mice (Q3TI03), there are five repeats of the RSfp motif, whereas in C57BL/6J mice there are six repeats. The rat Sfr1 homologue (rCG57555) has two repeats. Repetition of the RSfp motif appears to be unique to rodents, as only a single RSfp motif is present in other mammals, including human, rabbit, dog and pig (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001160.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). The RSfp motif is not present outside of mammals, although the downstream region is conserved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001160.s001">Figure S1D</xref>).</p>

<title>Mouse Swi5 and Sfr1 form a complex <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic></title>
<p>In fission yeast and in budding yeast, Swi5/Sae3 and Sfr1/Mei5 form a stable complex <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. To determine whether mouse Swi5 and Sfr1 interact, we performed a yeast two-hybrid assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Swi5 fused to the Gal4 activation domain (AD) and Sfr1 fused to the Gal4 DNA binding domain (DBD) gave a positive interaction, suggesting a physical association between the two. The reverse test was uninformative as Swi5 fused to the Gal4DBD itself allowed growth on the test medium. In addition, Sfr1 showed self-association, which has also been observed in fission yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Akamatsu2">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>We also tested complex formation with a GST pull-down assay using recombinant proteins expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Unlike expression of yeast Sfr1/Mei5, which yields insoluble protein without co-expression of Swi5/Sae3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Haruta1">[30]</xref>, , mouse His<sub>6</sub>-Sfr1 was soluble by itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The tagged Sfr1 migrated at a higher molecular weight (∼50 kDa) than the molecular weight calculated from the amino acid sequence (36 kDa). An unexpected lower mobility was seen with the endogenous Sfr1 protein (see below, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). The <italic>E. coli</italic> extract expressing His<sub>6</sub>-Sfr1 was incubated with GST-Swi5 or GST alone immobilized on magnetic beads. Pull-down of GST-Swi5, but not GST, brought down His<sub>6</sub>-Sfr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), again indicating a physical association between Swi5 and Sfr1.</p>

<p>To determine their interacting domains, two-hybrid and GST pull-down assays were performed with N and C-terminal fragments from both proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The N-terminal half of Swi5, but not the C-terminal half, interacted with Sfr1 in both assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g001">Figure 1D and 1F</xref>). Conversely, the C-terminal fragment of Sfr1, but not the N-terminal fragment, interacted with Swi5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g001">Figure 1E and 1G</xref>). The interacting fragments from both proteins contain coiled-coil motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), which may be responsible for the interaction. Consistent with their variability in different species, the RSfp motifs of Sfr1 did not appear to play a role in the interaction.</p>
<p>Co-immunoprecipitations were performed with mouse ES cell extracts to investigate the interaction <italic>in vivo</italic>. Using antibodies directed against the endogenous proteins, Swi5 co-precipitated Sfr1 and Sfr1 co-precipitated Swi5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g001">Figure 1H</xref>). Most of the Swi5 in the cell seems to be in a complex with Sfr1. Thus, despite the poor sequence conservation overall, Sfr1 is a major interacting partner for the Swi5 in the cell, consistent with the better conservation of the Sfr1 C-terminal portion, which interacts with Swi5.</p>

The <italic>Swi5</italic> targeting vector was designed to replace the exons 3 and 4 with a <italic>neomycin resistance</italic> gene (<italic>neo</italic>), resulting in deletion of most of the Swi5 coding sequence, including the sequence for Sfr1 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001160.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). In the <italic>Sfr1</italic> targeting vector, the <italic>neo</italic> gene replaced exons 2 and 3, which encode amino acids 5 to 240, removing 78% of the coding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g002">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001160.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). Two rounds of gene targeting were performed, with an intervening step to delete the <italic>neo</italic> gene from the first targeted allele using Cre recombinase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001160.s003">Figure S3A and S3B</xref>). Successful gene targeting of both <italic>Swi5</italic> and <italic>Sfr1</italic> alleles in the respective cell lines was confirmed by Southern blotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001160.s003">Figure S3A and S3B</xref>), and loss of protein was confirmed by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) and immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). The <italic>Swi5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Sfr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cell lines (formally <italic>Swi5<sup>Δ/neo</sup></italic> and <italic>Sfr1<sup>Δ/neo</sup></italic>, respectively) exhibited similar proliferation kinetics and cell cycle distribution as wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g002">Figure 2D and 2E</xref>), indicating that Swi5 and Sfr1 are not essential for cell viability.</p>
<p>As Swi5 and Sfr1 form a complex, we determined whether loss of one affects the stability of the other by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Swi5 protein was not detectable in <italic>Sfr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells, indicating that the stability of Swi5 requires association with Sfr1. The level of Sfr1 in <italic>Swi5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells was also diminished, although the protein was still detectable. These results provide further evidence for a physical association between Swi5 and Sfr1 <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>To determine the sub-cellular localization of Swi5 and Sfr1, mouse ES cells and embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were examined by immunofluorescence. Swi5 and Sfr1 localized to the nucleus in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g002">Figure 2F and 2G</xref>). Importantly, Swi5 was not detected in <italic>Sfr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> ES cells, providing further support that Swi5 is unstable without Sfr1; Sfr1 was detectable in <italic>Swi5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> ES cells, albeit weakly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). In fission yeast, Swi5 localizes to heterochromatin as well as to euchromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Akamatsu1">[26]</xref>. However, neither mouse protein specifically localized to heterochromatin, as marked by trimethyl-lysine 9 of histone H3 and intense DAPI staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). Rather, both proteins had a more widespread nuclear distribution that was, nonetheless, somewhat granular.</p>

<p>We tested whether Swi5 and Sfr1 co-localize with Rad51 in nuclear foci after X-irradiation.

<title>HR is reduced in <italic>Swi5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Sfr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells when HR is compromised</title>
<p>The conservation of the protein complex and the interaction with Rad51 suggested that Swi5-Sfr1 could play a role in HR in mammalian cells. We examined HR levels in the <italic>Swi5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Sfr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> ES cells using the DR-GFP assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Pierce1">[37]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In this assay, a single DSB is introduced into the chromosomally integrated DR-GFP substrate by the I-<italic>Sce</italic>I endonuclease; repair of the DSB by HR gives rise to cells expressing functional GFP. After I-<italic>Sce</italic>I expression, <italic>Swi5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Sfr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells gave similar levels of GFP positive cells (4.9% and 4.4%, respectively) as wild-type cells (5.2%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that Swi5 and Sfr1 are not essential for HR in mouse cells.</p>
<p>In fission yeast, the Swi5-Sfr1 complex stabilizes Rad51 filament formation on single-stranded DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Kurokawa1">[38]</xref>. We hypothesized that if Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments were perturbed in mouse cells, a role for the Swi5-Sfr1 complex in HR might be uncovered. BRCA2 is a central HR protein in mammalian cells, binding Rad51 at a series of repeats ∼35 amino acids (BRC repeats); as an isolated peptide, the BRC repeat has been demonstrated to bind Rad51, to inhibit Rad51 focus formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Galkin1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Yuan1">[41]</xref> and, importantly, to decrease HR in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Stark1">[42]</xref>. Compared to cells transfected with an empty expression vector (5.8%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), expression of BRC3 in wild-type cells resulted in a significantly reduced frequency of GFP positive cells (0.55%) and hence HR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g003">Figure 3E</xref>), consistent with previous results. This inhibitory effect on HR was not observed with expression of the BRC3Δ peptide which is unable to bind Rad51 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Davies1">[43]</xref> (6.6%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g003">Figure 3F</xref>) and, further, was rescued by Rad51 overexpression (data not shown).</p>
<p>With BRC3 expression, <italic>Swi5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Sfr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells exhibited a 2.1-fold and 1.9-fold reduction of GFP positive cells (0.26% and 0.29%, respectively) compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g003">Figure 3E</xref>), indicating that Swi5-Sfr1 plays a role in HR when it is compromised. Consistent with this interpretation, expression of the cognate cDNAs complemented the HR defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). The defect in HR was dependent on the ability of the BRC3 repeat to bind Rad51, as a similar number of GFP positive cells were obtained with BRC3Δ expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). These results indicate that the Swi5 and Sfr1 function in HR, but are not required for the process unless it is already compromised. Because BRC3 perturbs Rad51 focus formation, mouse Swi5-Sfr1 may play a role in stabilizing Rad51 filaments, as in fission yeast.</p>

<p>Cells were also exposed to topoisomerase poisons, which like X-rays lead to strand breaks. Both <italic>Swi5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Sfr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells exhibited sensitivity to the type I topoisomerase poison camptothecin, although not as severely as <italic>Brca2<sup>lex1/lex2</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Sfr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells were somewhat more sensitive to camptothecin than <italic>Swi5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells. <italic>Sfr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells were also sensitive to the type II topoisomerase poison etoposide. The two mutants again showed differential sensitivity, with <italic>Sfr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells showing a more severe phenotype. In this case, <italic>Sfr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells were even more sensitive than <italic>Brca2<sup>lex1/lex2</sup></italic> cells, whereas <italic>Swi5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells were no more sensitive than wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). These results suggest that Swi5 and Sfr1 have a function in repairing DNA strand breaks, the primary lesions from X-irradiation and topoisomerase poisons. Given the greater sensitivity observed in <italic>Sfr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells, they also indicate that the roles of Swi5 and Sfr1 are not equivalent in the cell.</p>
<p>Cells with defective DNA damage checkpoints often exhibit sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. Chk1 and Chk2 are two proteins that are phosphorylated upon X-irradiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Hirao1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Liu1">[46]</xref>. After X-irradiation, <italic>Swi5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Sfr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells were proficient at phosphorylation of both proteins and showed similar kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Checkpoint-proficient cells also arrest after DNA damage rather than proceed into mitosis.

<p>We also tested the sensitivity of <italic>Swi5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Sfr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells to a variety of other DNA damaging agents. HR mutants are typically sensitive to interstrand crosslinking agents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Liu2">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Yu2">[49]</xref>, yet we observed that <italic>Swi5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Sfr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells were not any more sensitive to either mitomycin C or cisplatin than wild-type or complemented cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001160.s005">Figure S5A and S5B</xref>). In addition, cells were not sensitive to the replication inhibitor hydroxyurea (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001160.s005">Figure S5C</xref>), implying that the camptothecin sensitivity is specifically related to strand breaks generated by this agent rather than indirectly to problems with replication per se. Finally, neither mutant was sensitive to ultraviolet light (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1001160.s005">Figure S5D</xref>), indicating that the proteins do not play a role in nucleotide excision repair.

<p>Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (Parp) plays an important role in the repair of DNA single-strand breaks, such that inhibition of Parp activity leads to the accumulation of the unrepaired single-strand breaks that turn into DSBs when encountered by replication forks.

<p>To further examine the effect of Parp inhibition on Swi5 and Sfr1-deficient cells, chromosomes were examined for aberrations in metaphase spreads. In <italic>Swi5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Sfr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells, chromatid breaks were elevated 30 and 20-fold, respectively, after exposure to olaparib compared with untreated cells, significantly more than that observed in wild-type cells (9-fold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Radial chromosomes, which were not observed in untreated cells, were also induced in <italic>Swi5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Sfr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells. Both of these types of aberrations typically arise from problems encountered during DNA replication. <italic>Brca2<sup>lex1/lex2</sup></italic> cells showed a substantial number of chromatid breaks even without olaparib, but chromatid breaks increased and radial chromosomes were observed upon olaparib treatment. The level of aberrations in olaparib-treated <italic>Brca2<sup>lex1/lex2</sup></italic> cells was similar to that found in the treated <italic>Swi5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Sfr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells, but aberrations may be underestimated if the G2/M checkpoint was activated. The observation of increased chromatid breaks and radial chromosomes in <italic>Swi5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Sfr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells suggest that unrepaired DSBs accumulate, which may be responsible for the toxicity observed with Parp inhibition in these cells.</p>
<p>The accumulation of chromatid breaks induced by Parp inhibition may be the result of HR deficiency. To test this, we examined sister-chromatid exchange (SCE), which is one of outcome of HR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1001160-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). The spontaneous SCE frequency was similar among wild-type, <italic>Swi5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Sfr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells (9.3, 9.3 and 9.7 SCEs per metaphase, respectively), while <italic>Brca2<sup>lex1/lex2</sup></italic> cells showed a lower frequency of SCE (7.1 SCEs per metaphase). With Parp inhibition, SCEs were significantly induced in wild-type cells (41.1 SCEs per metaphase) as well as in <italic>Brca2<sup>lex1/lex2</sup></italic> cells, although the overall level was lower (30.1 SCEs per metaphase). In <italic>Swi5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Sfr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells, the overall level of SCEs was reduced compared with wild type (35.0 and 35.4 SCEs per metaphase, respectively). These results indicate that SCE induction by Parp inhibition is partially dependent on Swi5 and Sfr1.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we identified Swi5 and Sfr1 orthologues in mammalian cells and determined that they have critical roles in the repair of DNA strand breaks. Despite their low conservation with the respective yeast proteins, we found that mouse Swi5 and Sfr1 form a complex <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, as do fission yeast Swi5 and Sfr1 and budding yeast Sae3 and Mei5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Akamatsu2">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Haruta1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Hayase1">[34]</xref>. The integral nature of the protein-protein interactions is emphasized by the mutual interdependence of the Swi5 and Sfr1 for stability, and by the finding that Sfr1 co-immunoprecipitates Swi5 to a similar extent as immunoprecipitation of Swi5 itself. Although the budding yeast complex is only expressed during meiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-McKee1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Hayase1">[34]</xref>, mouse Swi5-Sfr1 is expressed in mitotically dividing cells, making it more akin to the fission yeast complex.</p>
<p>We found that Swi5 or Sfr1-deficient mammalian cells are sensitive to agents that cause DNA strand breaks, including X-rays, camptothecin, and the Parp inhibitor olaparib. Consistent with a DNA damage repair defect in <italic>Swi5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Sfr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells, chromosome aberrations are increased compared to wild-type when cells are challenged with olaparib. For the most part, the sensitivities of <italic>Swi5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Sfr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells are similar to each other, although unlike <italic>Swi5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells, <italic>Sfr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells are also sensitive to etoposide. In contrast to Swi5, the stability of Sfr1 is not fully compromised when its partner protein is absent, consistent with Sfr1 functions that are independent of Swi5 in some contexts, as is the case with fission yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Willis1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Willis2">[53]</xref>. While fission yeast Swi5 acts independent of Sfr1 during mating-type switching, mouse Swi5 is unlikely to have Sfr1-independent functions, given its instability in the absence of Sfr1.</p>
<p>Sensitivity to camptothecin and olaparib is consistent with a defect in the ability to repair DNA damage by HR. That Swi5 interacts with Rad51 <italic>in vitro</italic>, the critical strand exchange protein for HR reactions, supports a role for the mammalian Swi5-Sfr1 complex in HR, like the cognate complexes in fission and budding yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Akamatsu1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Tsubouchi1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Hayase1">[34]</xref>. Further, DNA damage-induced SCEs are reduced in <italic>Swi5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Sfr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells compared with wild-type cells. Moreover, although direct assay of DSB-induced HR in these cells did not reveal an intrinsic HR defect, a more severe defect in HR is observed in both the <italic>Swi5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Sfr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells when HR is compromised by interfering with Rad51 function.</p>
<p>Unlike typical mammalian HR mutants, however, <italic>Swi5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Sfr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells are not sensitive to interstrand crosslinking agents or the replication inhibitor hydroxyurea. Although both agents lead to DSBs during S phase and induce HR, DSBs are detected by pulse field gel electrophoresis only after prolonged incubation with these agents and require the structure-specific nuclease Mus81 for their formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Hanada1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Hanada2">[55]</xref>. By contrast, when a replication fork encounters a single-strand break, a one-ended DSB is generated with fast kinetics, as DSBs appear within 30 min after camptothecin exposure during S phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Arnaudeau1">[56]</xref>. In fission yeast, evidence points to a role for Swi5-Sfr1 (or Swi5-Swi2) acting specifically at one end of a DSB or at the one-ended DSBs at the <italic>mat</italic> locus during either mating-type switching or sister chromatid recombination in donorless strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Akamatsu1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Roseaulin1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Arcangioli1">[58]</xref>. Taken together, we propose that Swi5-Sfr1 is an evolutionarily conserved complex that acts at specific types of lesions, specifically at one-ended DSBs.</p>
<p>These experiments reveal a role for the mammalian Swi5-Sfr1 complex in HR. Although Swi5-Sfr1 are required for repair when the DNA damage load is high, the role of the complex appears to be more restricted than that of BRCA2 and the Rad51 paralogues, given the more severe phenotype seen when these other proteins are deficient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Pierce1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Moynahan2">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Johnson2">[59]</xref>. In fission yeast, which does not have a BRCA2 orthologue, both Swi5-Sfr1 and the Rad51 paralogue complex Rhp55-Rhp57 are required for high levels of HR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Akamatsu1">[26]</xref>. Thus, a shift in dependence on the Swi5-Sfr1 complex may have occurred during evolution. How might Swi5-Sfr1 function in HR? <italic>In vitro</italic>, the fission yeast Swi5-Sfr1 complex has mediator activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Haruta1">[30]</xref>. Moreover, the fission yeast Swi5-Sfr1 complex stabilizes the Rad51 filament on single-stranded DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Kurokawa1">[38]</xref>. We hypothesize that the mammalian complex plays a similar role, given the reduced recombination in <italic>Swi5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>Sfr1<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells in the presence of the BRC3 repeat, which is known to perturb Rad51 focus formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Chen1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Yuan1">[41]</xref>.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy, however, that the interaction of the Swi5-Sfr1 complex with Rad51 is through Swi5, in contrast to fission yeast where the interaction with Rhp51 is through Sfr1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Akamatsu2">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Haruta1">[30]</xref>. In both mouse cells and fission yeast, the interaction between Swi5-Sfr1 and Rad51 is detected <italic>in vitro</italic>, but not <italic>in vivo</italic>, as co-precipitation of the endogenous proteins has been unsuccessful, even under DNA damaging conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Akamatsu2">[29]</xref>. Thus, Swi5-Sfr1 and Rad51 may interact weakly or transiently in cells. In fission and budding yeast, Swi5-Sfr1 and Sae3-Mei5, respectively, bind and promote the activity of Dmc1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Haruta1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Tsubouchi1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Hayase1">[34]</xref>, the meiosis-specific strand exchange protein, which is also critical for mouse meiosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Pittman1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Yoshida1">[61]</xref>. Whether Swi5-Sfr1 plays a similar role in mammalian cells awaits mouse knockout studies of the complex, although notably we have detected high level of expression of the complex in the testis, including a testis-specific isoform of Swi5 (Y.A. and M.J., unpublished results).</p>
<p>In summary, we have characterized a novel complex critical for DNA strand break repair in mammalian cells. The importance of strand break repair is well recognized, as defective repair is associated with various neurodegenerative diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Caldecott1">[62]</xref>. Moreover, therapeutic approaches to some cancers are being developed which increase the cellular load of DNA strand breaks through Parp inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1001160-Rouleau1">[63]</xref>. The identification of Swi5-Sfr1 as being important for cellular resistance to agents like olaparib therefore has potential clinical as well as biological relevance.</p>
