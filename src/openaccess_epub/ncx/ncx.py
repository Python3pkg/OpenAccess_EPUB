This module provides the basic tools necessary to create the NCX (Navigation
Center eXtended) file for ePub. The specification for this file is a subsection
of the OPF specification. See:

http://www.idpf.org/epub/20/spec/OPF_2.0.1_draft.htm#Section2.4.1
http://www.niso.org/workrooms/daisy/Z39-86-2005.html#NCX

The NCX file is REQUIRED for valid ePub, but readers support it OPTIONALLY. Its
job is to provide a more advanced Table of Contents-style navigation system for
the ePub beyond what is done in the OPF file.
